# Healthcare Billing Discrepancy & Reimbursement Analysis

This project analyzes healthcare billing discrepancies and reimbursement trends using SQL and Mode Analytics. The dataset includes 100 anonymized healthcare claims, and the analysis highlights key metrics such as reimbursement rates, denial rates, discrepancies by provider, and more.

## Purpose

To identify:
- Discrepancies between the amounts billed and paid
- Insurance denial patterns
- Reimbursement performance by service type and provider
- Monthly trends in healthcare billing and payments

## Tools Used

- **SQL** (PostgreSQL)
- **Mode Analytics** for querying, visualization, and dashboard building
- **GitHub** for version control and publishing

## Key Insights

- **100 total claims** analyzed across **52 unique patients**
- **Average discrepancy per claim:** 40
- **No claim denials** recorded in the dataset
- **Reimbursement rates** range from **66.67% to 79%**
- **Some providers** show consistent reimbursement gaps
- **Services like ECG/EKG** had the lowest reimbursement rate (66.67%)
- **Monthly trends** indicate seasonality or operational influences

## Charts & Visuals

- Total Billed vs Paid (bar & line)
- Average Reimbursement % by Service
- Denial Rate by Insurance & Service
- Discrepancy by Provider
- Fully Reimbursed Claim Ratio
- Monthly Billing Trends

## Files in This Repo

- `README.md` – project overview
- `screenshots/` – contains Mode Analytics visual snapshots
- `exports/` – contains PDF or HTML report exports (optional)
- `summary.md` or `notebook.md` – executive summary and observations

## Recommendations

- Investigate services with low reimbursement (e.g., ECG/EKG)
- Follow up with providers who show high discrepancies
- Track monthly fluctuations to identify peak underpayments

## Report Sharing

- Mode Analytics dashboard shared via internal link
- Exported reports available for offline reference
